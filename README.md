# Discord-ToggleToTalk
This is a simple Autohotkey script that gives the user an option to have a single key press emulate holding down the "Push to talk" key while it is running. It is recommended to also bind a "Toggle to mute" key somewhere just for convenience sake.  
The only thing required from the user is to go into **Discord settings** > **Voice & Video** > and set the **Input mode** to **Push to Talk** and bind the **F9** key.  
The script is then invoked with a single press of the **F8** key, that's your Toggle to Talk key.  
I've included in the [Releases] section a compiled .exe for users that don't have Autohotkey installed on their machines.
