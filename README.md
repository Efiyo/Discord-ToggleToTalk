# Discord-ToggleToTalk
This is a simple Autohotkey script that gives the user an option to have a single key press emulate holding down the "Push to talk" key while it is running. It is recommended to also bind a "Toggle to mute" key somewhere just for convenience sake.  
The only thing required from the user is to go into **Discord settings** > **Voice & Video** > and set the **Input mode** to **Push to Talk** and bind the **F9** key.  
The script is then invoked with a single press of the **F8** key, that's your Toggle to Talk key. (I know it's stupid to put those keys but anyone can just change the key to the one they desire in the script itself)  
I've included in the [Releases](https://github.com/Efiyo/Discord-ToggleToTalk/releases) section a compiled .exe for users that don't have Autohotkey installed on their machines.
